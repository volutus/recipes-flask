# Lemon Pepper Shrimp over Pasta

## Ingredients
- 2.5 servings (140g) dry pasta
    - I think you can use most shapes here but penne and elbows are quite nice.
- 1 serving (80g) frozen shrimp
    - You could likely use other protein here but cut them down to at least shrimp size, if not smaller.
    - The shrimp is cooked beforehand and tossed in at the end
- 1 tablespoon (14g) olive oil
- Lemon pepper seasoning
- MSG 
- Other seasonings to taste
    - I use red chili powder for taste / color

## Directions
1. Prepare and cook shrimp to completion. This will vary a bit depending on how your shrimp was prepared.
2. Strain and shock shrimp with ice to stop cooking. Place into bowl with a pinch of your oil and some lemon pepper seasoning marinate
3. Cook the pasta to al dente (1-2 minutes short of box instructions). Strain, making sure to keep some cooking water
4. Add oil to the hot pan and bloom your lemon pepper seasoning. Once it's going, toss in the shrimp and pasta and have your water ready to go.
5. Once the mixture seems to be "drying up", toss in some of the water to create a cohesive sauce. Start light here -- it's easy to add more water but very hard to remove.
6. Cook until you have a cohesive sauce, stirring constantly. Watch this carefully as it can go from "watery sauce" to "burnt" in a minute.
